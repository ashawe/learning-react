# [Build a Web App with React](https://glitch.com/glimmer/post/react-starter-kit/)

## A free, 5-part (5 min each) video course with interactive code examples that will help you learn React.

### Contents

- Part 1: Intro to React ( Basically what and why. You can skip this)
- Part 2: React Starter ( Webpack, jsx, components ( & props ) intro )
- Part 3: React Router ( How routing works in react )
- Part 4: React Redux ( Managing state using react redux - Redux, actions )
- Part 5: What's Next?

## Explanation ( Why you can skip this? )

It basically explains react js via their website glitch.com which is like an online code editor. At first it might look a bit weird because basically all the files in the left sidebar aren't indented. Rather their full path is shown and everything is left aligned.

The explaination is not completely lucid but if you've done overview of react by Tania Rascia, then you probably will understand most of what they're trying to explain. Still it covers some advanced parts like routers & redux. These parts are a little complicated and the videos don't properly cover how they work. It just shows where what is written and gives definition of each element (e.g. redux).

#### Since everything they explained is on their website (glitch.com), there is no code in this folder.
